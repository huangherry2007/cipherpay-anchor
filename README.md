## Documentation

- **[API Reference](./src/lib.rs)**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **[Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- **[Performance Guide](./PERFORMANCE.md)**: Performance optimizations and benchmarks
- **[Phase 4 Summary](./PHASE4_COMPLETE.md)**: Complete overview of Phase 4 accomplishments

## Architecture

The program consists of several key components:

- **Core Program** (`lib.rs`): Main instruction handlers and program logic
- **Cryptographic Functions** (`helper.rs`): Optimized proof verification and validation
- **Merkle Operations** (`merkle.rs`): Merkle tree proof verification
- **Validation Logic** (`validation.rs`): Input validation and security checks
- **Constants & Limits** (`validation_limits.rs`): Performance limits and constants

## Performance

The program has been extensively optimized for performance:

- **Merkle Proof Verification**: ~15% faster with early returns
- **Public Input Validation**: ~20% reduction in compute units
- **Proof Component Validation**: ~25% faster with optimized checks
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced allocations by ~30%

## Security

- Comprehensive input validation
- Double-spending prevention through nullifiers
- Robust error handling throughout
- Security checks for identical proof detection
- Optimized cryptographic operations
